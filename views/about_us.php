<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
<p><br>
  It is an organization  intended to make the people of the country more aware with the politics and  political happenings of India.<br>
</p><br>

<p>The basic aim of making this website is to  make people aware that politics is not that bad as we think of. It is us who  neglect it and allow an undeserving person to come to power and exploit the  nation. So, if we participate in it (may not be actively) and choose wisely,  our nation could emerge and prosper more. <br>
  </p><br>

<p>The people in the country might also ignore  to know about politics, especially party and leaders because they donâ€™t get  such a detail information at one platform.<br>
  So, this is the initiative taken by us and  hope that the people would remain updated about political happenings of the  country and also select or choose their leaders wisely in the forthcoming  general election and also in every other elections as we would be covering all  the state elections too after this 2014 lok sabha election.</p>
